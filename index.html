        <h2>Sputnik 1</h2>
        <p class="left">D A T E : October 4, 1957.
            <br>S T R U C T U R E : The satellite in Sputnik 1 was an aluminum sphere with four whisker-like antennas. The spacecraft collected data on the density of the upper layers of the atmosphere. 
            <br>I M P O R T A N C E : Sputnik 1 was the first satellite to to ever be put into Earth's orbit.

        <p class="right">D A T E : January 31, 1958.
            <br>S T R U C T U R E : Explorer 1 contained a cosmic ray detector which was used to measure the radiation in Earth's orbit.
            <br>I M P O R T A N C E : The U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency was instructed to launch a satellite (Explorer 1) in response to Sputnik 1 which was launched by the Soviet Union.

        <h2>Vostok 1</h2>
        <p class="left">D A T E : April 12, 1961.
            <br>S T R U C T U R E : The cabin of the spacecraft is spherical with three small windows and radio antennas on the outside. The cabin is attatched to a service module with orientation rockets and chemical batteries, and the astronaut sits on an ejection seat that ejects with a parachute right before landing.
            <br>I M P O R T A N C E : Vostok 1 was the first spacecraft to hold a human, Yuri A. Gagarin, and take them to space. The spacecraft orbited Earth once then re-entered the atmosphere and landed Kazakhstan.

        <p class="right">D A T E : May 5, 1961.
            <br>S T R U C T U R E : The spacecraft had a cylindrical cabin with a window to the left of the passenger, Alan Shepard.
            <br>I M P O R T A N C E : The Mercury-Redstone 3 was launched after the Vistok 1 , which sent the first man into space. The Mercury-Redstone 3 sent the first person to space by the U.S.

        <h2>Apollo 11</h2>
        <p class="left">D A T E : July 16, 1969.
            <br>S T R U C T U R E : The Apollo 11 spacecraft had a command module that housed the crew and service module which was cased in honeycomb aluminum pannels. There was also a heat sheild under the capsule for re-entry.
            <br>I M P O R T A N C E : Apollo 11 held Niel Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins, and successfully landed them on the surface of the moon, making them the first men to ever reach the moon. This also complete the national goal that President John F. Kennedy set: to send a man to the moon.
